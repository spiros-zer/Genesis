      <h2>End Goal</h2>
      <p>
      <strike>How to put it ... currently there is no goal. Will I create a huge animation pack for Manny, will I put them to some Paragon character? I am not really sure. <em>I think that huge animation pack for Manny is the best course, but how am I supposed to fdit all these in this repo here</em> ü§î</strike> A huge library of animations for Manny. All of them will have fx, sounds, anim_notifs setup. It will be categorized <em>per weapon of character</em>. For example a folder of Countess that will have her weapons and the animations executed with said weapons.

      <h2>Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        On the repo should be <strong>only</strong> Manny animations. On base station there will be all the Paragon characters. In the future &mdash; once the characters' setup is completed &mdash; I will create a different repo to put them all inside.

        <h2>Character Rigs</h2>
        <p>
          <strike>So far, Countess and Aurora</strike> The humanoids of Paragon follow the UE4 Mannequin skeleton archetype &mdash; of 3 spines, no finger metacarpals, no twists, etc. <em>ofc</em> there are exceptions to that due to weapon modifications, anatomy blah blah blah &mdash;. <strong>But</strong> I will still go with making a retargetter for Manny who comes with a UE4 mannequin rtg anyways. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Good IK Rig and good IK Retargetter gives very good animation.</li>
          <li>All anim_notifs for events, particles, emitters and whatnot carry over the retargetting ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Aurora Issues</h4>
        <p>
          In short, <strike>I hate her</strike> she is a little difficult. The physics assets have issues and need to be remade from scratch, skeleton is ubalanced &mdash; one hand has metacarpals the other no, armor, hair with bones, animations are not that pretty after all; I am sure if I keep looking i will find more &mdash;

      <section id="section-meshes">
        <h2>Meshes</h2>
        <p>
          So in order to make the animations bound to the weapon rather than the character, I need to extract the weapon mesh from the character mesh. Now, Epic again does not want to make my life easier, but alas I found a way to do it:
          <ol>
            <li>Make <code>Static Mesh</code> from the <code>Skeletal Mesh</code> &mdash; this step is optional if a static mesh already exists</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Asset Actions Export</strong> it and choose as save type <strong>gltf</strong> &mdash; the reason it is important to go with .gltf and not just export as .fb is that the materials are not exported and after tedious googling and some testing .gltf is the way. It is important to jnote that at some point the material quality was very low so in the export setting syou need to set the <strong>Default Material bake Size to 2048 x 2048</strong></li>
            <li>The it is <em>Blender</em> time. In blender you need to import the .gltf file, delete the character mesh and <strong>center the point where you want the character to touch the weapon</strong> &mdash; will update on dual handed weapons later</li>
            <li>Export from blender as .fbx and then importi it in UE5</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="section-fx">
        <h2>FX</h2>
        <p>
          <strike>Since the Paragon assets were using the <strong>Cascade Particle System</strong>, they had to be converted to <strong>Niagara Particle System</strong>. As I was told by my good friend <a href="">Stylianos</a>, Unreal has the amazing plugin Cascade To Niagara Converter which gets the job done, <strong>BUT</strong> the converted FX have issues and some won't play at all üòÄ. So we need to fix that <em>obviosuly</em></strike> Due to the many unsolvable issues that piled up (see bellow) I will be doing Niagara only to the FX that are 100% no issue working.
