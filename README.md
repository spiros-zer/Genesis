      <p>
      <strike>How to put it ... currently there is no goal. Will I create a huge animation pack for Manny, will I put them to some Paragon character? I am not really sure. <em>I think that huge animation pack for Manny is the best course, but how am I supposed to fdit all these in this repo here</em> ü§î</strike> A huge library of animations for Manny. All of them will have fx, sounds, anim_notifs setup. It will be categorized <em>per weapon of character</em>. For example a folder of Countess that will have her weapons and the animations executed with said weapons.

        Workflow

      <p>
        On the repo should be <strong>only</strong> Manny animations. On base station there will be all the Paragon characters. In the future &mdash; once the characters' setup is completed &mdash; I will create a different repo to put them all inside.

          <strike>So far, Countess and Aurora</strike> The humanoids of Paragon follow the UE4 Mannequin skeleton archetype &mdash; of 3 spines, no finger metacarpals, no twists, etc. <em>ofc</em> there are exceptions to that due to weapon modifications, anatomy blah blah blah &mdash;. <strong>But</strong> I will still go with making a retargetter for Manny who comes with a UE4 mannequin rtg anyways.

          FX

        <p>
          Since the Paragon assets were using the <strong>Cascade Particle System</strong>, they had to be converted to <strong>Niagara Particle System</strong>. As I was told by my good friend <a href="">Stylianos</a>, Unreal has the amazing plugin Cascade To Niagara Converter which gets the job done, <strong>BUT</strong> the converted FX have issues and some won't play at all üòÄ. So we need to fix that <em>obviosuly</em>.

          In short, <strike>I hate her</strike> she is a little difficult. The physics assets have issues and need to be remade from scratch, skeleton is ubalanced &mdash; one hand has metacarpals the other no, armor, hair with bones, animations are not that pretty after all; I am sure if I keep looking i will find more &mdash;

            Good IK Rig and good IK Retargetter gives very good animation.

            All anim_notifs for events, particles, emitters and whatnot carry over the retargetting ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
