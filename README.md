        End Goal

      <p>
      How to put it ... currently there is no goal. Will I create a huge animation pack for Manny, will I put them to some Paragon character? I am not really sure. <em>I think that huge animation pack for Manny is the best course, but how am I supposed to fdit all these in this repo here</em> ðŸ¤”

          <strike>So far, Countess and Aurora</strike> The humanoids of Paragon follow the UE4 Mannequin skeleton archetype &mdash; of 3 spines, no finger metacarpals, no twists, etc. <em>ofc</em> there are exceptions to that due to weapon modifications, anatomy blah blah blah &mdash;. <strong>But</strong> I will still go with making a retargetter for Manny who comes with a UE4 mannequin rtg anyways.

        <p>
          In short, <strike>I hate her</strike> she is a little difficult. The physics assets have issues and need to be remade from scratch, skeleton is ubalanced &mdash; one hand has metacarpals the other no, armor, hair with bones, animations are not that pretty after all; I am sure if I keep looking i will find more &mdash;
